# ELEMENTS

An extensible Library to Experiment Methodologies on Electronic and Nuclear Theories for Spectroscopy

A small library primarily written in modern Fortran (2008) for code prototyping on electronic/nuclear theories.

## Content

The library proposes an ensemble of Fortran modules and small programs using these modules.

## Requirements

* XMake (https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake) is required to compile the project.
  There is currently a legacy make file maintained for testing purposes but its use is discouraged as it may not be kept updated.
* FORD (https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) is required to build the API documentation.
